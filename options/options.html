				<p>Store master password on this options page.

					Don&rsquo;t worry, the password itself is not stored,
					only its hash is.
			<li>
				<p>On any website, focus a password box and choose your password
					from the menu by pressing buttons <kbd>1</kbd> to <kbd>9</kbd>.
			<li>
				<p>The first time you use a password since opening your browser,
					the extension will ask you to unlock it.

				<p class=clarify>
					Careful!
					Evil website owners might want to steal your password,
					so always make sure that the popup says
					&lsquo;SuperGenPass for Google Chrome™ by Denis extension
					says&rsquo; and not &lsquo;The page at ... says:&rsquo;!
			<li>
				<p>
					That&rsquo;s it,
					the password field is now filled with your generated password.
